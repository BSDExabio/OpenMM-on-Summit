# Minimization and Analysis

This subdirectory holds some python code that can be spun up to run a Dask workflow that utilizes two heterogenous types of workers. Similar to the `dask_tskmgr.py` in the above directory, but running some analysis code on the available CPU resources while simulations are running. 

```
bsub simple.sh
```
